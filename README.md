In this Unit, you will program a car moving side-to-side on a floating road, trying to avoid (or hit) obstacles in the way. In addition to becoming familiar with the Unity editor and workflow, you will learn how to create new C# scripts and do some simple programming. By the end of the Unit, you will be able to call basic functions, then declare and tweak new variables to modify the results of those functions.

Challenge Overview:
Use the skills you learned in the driving simulation to fly a plane around obstacles in the sky. You will have to get the user’s input from the up and down arrows in order to control the plane’s pitch up and down. You will also have to make the camera follow alongside the plane so you can keep it in view.

Challenge Outcome:
1. The plane moves forward at a constant rate
2. The up/down arrows tilt the nose of the plane up and down
3. The camera follows along beside the plane as it flies
